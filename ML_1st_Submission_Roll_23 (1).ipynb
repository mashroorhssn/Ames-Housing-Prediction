More importantly, it reveals a mix of data types (`int64`, `float64`, `object`) and a significant number of missing (null) values in columns like `LotFrontage`, `Alley`, `MasVnrType`, `FireplaceQu`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`, and `MiscFeature`. This tells us that preprocessing will be a major part of this project, as seen in the `DSE_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook."

        "This is the most critical preparation step, based on the methods from my course notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Analyze and Transform Target Variable:** The first two plots show that our target variable, `SalePrice`, is \"right-skewed.\" Regression models work best on a normally distributed target. By applying a log transformation (`np.log1p`), the second plot shows we've successfully normalized the data. Our model will now predict the *log* of the price.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Feature Selection:** I drop the `Id` column because it's just an identifier, not a predictive feature. I also drop `Alley`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`, and `MiscFeature` because the `.info()` output showed they are missing over 80% of their data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Train-Valid-Test Split:** I follow the robust methodology from my course. I first split the data into a 70% Training set and a 30% \"Holdout\" set. I then split that holdout set in half, resulting in three final datasets:\n",
        "    * **Training (70%):** To fit the model.\n",
        "    * **Validation (15%):** To tune the model.\n",
        "    * **Test (15%):** For final, unbiased scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Create Preprocessing Pipelines:** The dataset has 34 numerical and 41 categorical features. I create two separate pipelines to handle them automatically, as shown in `Cali_scale_reg.ipynb` and `DSE_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`:\n",
        "    * **Numerical Pipeline:** Imputes missing values with the `median` (which is safer than `mean` for skewed data) and then scales all features with `StandardScaler`.\n",
        "    * **Categorical Pipeline:** Imputes missing values with the `most_frequent` value and then converts all text categories into numerical columns using `OneHotEncoder`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the `ColumnTransformer` bundles these pipelines together."

        "* **Why it's a good choice for this dataset:**\n",
        "    1.  **Handles Complexity:** The Ames dataset has many (75) features. A Random Forest can effectively handle this high dimensionality and automatically determine which features are important and which are not.\n",
        "    2.  **Prevents Overfitting:** A single decision tree can easily \"memorize\" the training data and fail on new data. By averaging hundreds of trees, the Random Forest model avoids this, leading to low variance and generalizing well to new data (as discussed in my `Model Training and Scoring.pdf`).\n",
        "    3.  **Works with Pipelines:** It works seamlessly inside a `sklearn` pipeline, allowing me to train a single object that handles all preprocessing and prediction.\n",

        "Finally, I train (`.fit()`) the entire pipeline on the **`X_train`** and **`y_train`** data."
